RESULTS

Through a survey conducted by us we inferred that 60% of the students responded better to understanding
concepts through visualization rather than their own imagination or the regular teaching methods.
 It's been proved time and again through different experiments and research on masses that any kind of
visual aid such as an image, a video or even an animation clip tends to be remembered more by humans.
 Not only will the visualization help but due to features of mazes and patterns in our application, the
students can relate the working of the algorithms to real life examples ( likes obstructions in the form of
walls).
 Often we see teachers struggling to make students understand concepts such as algorithms without it
getting monotonous, that's where our project comes into play as a great teaching aid. Because of our user
friendly and engaging interface the problem of distraction or losing interest tends to decrease, making it
very efficient.
 Our project can easily be incorporated alongside our education system by promoting different ways of
learning rather than the age old blackboard method as we just need to access a website hosted on the
internet to use the application.
 And with uncertain times like nowadays, we cannot only afford to be dependent only on our teachers and
one to one offline teaching to understand different concepts. E-learning is the new age learning technique
and our project is a step towards reinforcing this method of learning.
